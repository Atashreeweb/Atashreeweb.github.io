        <p>Hello! My name is Atashree Mondal. I am a graduate student continuing my second semester in Computer Science major at Bridgewater state university. My hobbies are trekking, skiing, trailing, kayaking and almost most of the outdoor activities. This may be the reason most of my favorite personal websites are of national parks. I connect with nature and animals well teaching humans about coexisting and adjusting to lead a fruitful life. I am always inclined towards learning new coding languages and acquiring in-depth knowledge of different application workflows. From a very young age, computers were my favorite subject and operating them would leave me with sheer feeling of ecstasy. My solutions towards the problem statement during the practical sessions and college hackathon made me realize my passion towards computer algorithm and thus induced the ambition of building a career around it. </p>
